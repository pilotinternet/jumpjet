To install JumpJet you need Drush and Drush_make on your server or localhost.
Information on these projects and instructions to install them can be found at:

We also recommend using JumpJet under Aegir - using JumpJet to create a
'platform' that Aegir then manages and creates sites on.

Navigate to the directory where you would like to build your JumpJet platform
and run the following command:

drush make http://github.com/pilotinternet/JumpJet/raw/master/jumpjet_build.make jumpjet

alternately, you can run:
wget http://github.com/pilotinternet/JumpJet/raw/master/jumpjet_build.make
