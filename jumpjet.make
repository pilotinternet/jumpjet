; JumpJet makefile
;
; It includes A LOT of module and themes. This is useful to create a toolbox
; for building the site initially. We build a lot of different sites all on
; the same platform, running under Aegir - so it's useful to have all these
; modules available. It makes creating updated platforms extremely easy, and
; you can then use Aegir's migrate feature.
;
; JumpJet can also be customised to create your own installation profile.
; To customise this makefile simply comment out un-required items with a
; semicolon at the start of the line.
; Add extra items at the end of the file
