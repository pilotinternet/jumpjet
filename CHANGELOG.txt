CHANGELOG

1.1 - 23rd June 2010
Streamlining the makefile a bit to make JumpJet more focused on just delivering
a platform to develop sites on. So removing frontend themes to leave only base 
themes, removing some modules that are too specific.
Impoving the specification of versions for key modules.
Adding patches to certain key modules.

1.0 - 16th June 2010
Initial public release of JumpJet, previously only used internally at Pilot.
